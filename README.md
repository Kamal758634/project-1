This project demonstrates the design and verification of a two-input XOR gate using Verilog HDL in Xilinx Vivado 2019.1. The flow of the project involves writing the Verilog RTL code, creating a testbench, running functional simulations, and then proceeding with synthesis and implementation. Through this process, the RTL schematic, simulation waveform, and FPGA device utilization were observed to ensure the correct functionality of the design.

The project was developed using Verilog as the hardware description language, with Vivado 2019.1 as the development environment. The target FPGA device used for implementation was Spartan-7 (xc7s15ftgb196-1). The Verilog module defines the XOR gate using the bitwise operator, and a simple testbench was written to verify its correctness by applying all possible input combinations.

The simulation results confirm the truth table of the XOR gate, where the output is high only when the inputs are different. The RTL schematic generated by Vivado shows the logic diagram of the XOR operation, while the waveform from the testbench confirms the expected functionality. After synthesis and implementation, the FPGA device utilization report verifies that the design was successfully mapped onto the Spartan-7 device.

In conclusion, the project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a two-input XOR gate using Verilog HDL. It verifies the design through simulation, synthesis, and FPGA implementation, matching the expected truth table results. This serves as a beginner-level digital design project and provides a foundation for more complex logic circuits in the future.
